## John Perry Barlow, founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation has passed away.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation [officially announced the death](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/john-perry-barlow-internet-pioneer-1947-2018) of it's founder, [John Perry Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow), yesterday morning. A man who helped to shape the web into what it is today by fighting for our rights to a free, open-access, and secure web without censorship or surveillance. 

For those unfamiliar with Barlow, I recommend reading ["A Not Terribly Brief History of the Electronic Frontier Foundation"](https://www.eff.org/pages/not-terribly-brief-history-electronic-frontier-foundation) by Barlow himself which details how EFF came to be.
