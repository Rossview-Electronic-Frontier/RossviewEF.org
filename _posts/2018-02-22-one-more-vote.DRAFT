# Operation \#OneMoreVote: Save Net Neutrality
We only need **one more vote** from congress to stop the Federal Communications Commissions' repeal of net neutrality. **Call your senators now.**

Rossview Electronic Frontier was first started to defend net neutrality and general online rights. On December 14th 2017, three of the five commissioners of the FCC repealed net neutrality protections under Title-II. However, Congress can still stop the repeal by enacting the Congressional Review Act (CRA). Starting 2/27, we have sixty days to gain fifty-one votes to stop the repeal; we already have **fifty**. If we are successful in getting a majority in Congress, we will still need a majority in the House of Representatives as well.
